  "text": "WebSockets are a communication protocol providing a persistent, bidirectional, full-duplex connection between a web client (typically a browser) and a web server.  This contrasts with the traditional HTTP protocol, which is stateless and relies on a request-response cycle.\n\nHere's a breakdown of key characteristics:\n\n* **Persistent Connection:** Once established, the WebSocket connection stays open, allowing continuous data flow in both directions without the need to constantly establish new connections like in HTTP. This significantly reduces latency and overhead.\n\n* **Bidirectional Communication:**  Data can be sent from the client to the server and vice-versa at any time, without waiting for a request. This enables real-time updates and interactions.\n\n* **Full-Duplex:**  Data can flow in both directions simultaneously, without interrupting the other direction.  Think of it like a phone call, where both parties can speak and listen at the same time.\n\n* **Low Latency:**  The persistent connection and bidirectional nature minimize delays, making WebSockets ideal for applications requiring real-time responsiveness.\n\n* **Built on Top of HTTP:**  While WebSockets provide a different communication model, they initially use HTTP to establish the connection (a \"handshake\"). After the handshake, communication switches to the WebSocket protocol.\n\n\n**How it works in simple terms:**\n\n1. **Handshake:** The client sends an HTTP request to the server, indicating its desire to upgrade to a WebSocket connection.  The server agrees, and the connection is established.\n\n2. **Data Exchange:** Once the connection is open, both the client and server can send data frames to each other at any time. These frames are small packets of information.\n\n3. **Connection Closure:** Either the client or the server can close the connection when it's no longer needed.\n\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\nWebSockets are well-suited for applications requiring real-time or near real-time interaction, such as:\n\n* **Chat applications:**  Instant messaging, group chats.\n* **Online gaming:**  Multiplayer games, real-time updates.\n* **Collaborative editing:**  Simultaneous document editing.\n* **Live streaming:**  Video and audio streaming.\n* **Financial tickers:**  Real-time stock prices, market data.\n* **Notification systems:**  Push notifications, real-time alerts.\n\n\n**Advantages over HTTP:**\n\n* **Reduced latency:**  Faster communication due to persistent connections.\n* **Real-time updates:**  Enables instant data synchronization.\n* **Efficient use of resources:**  Fewer connections and less overhead compared to repeated HTTP requests.\n\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n* **More complex implementation:**  Requires handling persistent connections and data framing.\n* **Firewall and proxy issues:**  Some firewalls and proxies might block WebSocket connections.  However, this is becoming less common.\n\n\nIn summary, WebSockets provide a powerful mechanism for real-time communication between web clients and servers, enabling a wide range of interactive and dynamic web applications.\n",
